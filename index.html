    <p>I discovered what networking means to me through investigation.
     I want people to realize that networking doesn't have to be artificial and fake all the time.
      Therefore I made the decision to outline my networking candidates in case I ever needed assistance.
       Through my explanation in the video, I hoped to educate my audience and express my gratitude to those who have helped me during the semester.
       I plan to meet others who work in the same profession as me because my aim is to become an entrepreneur in the fashion industry.
        I'm not advocating that you seek out influential individuals; rather, I believe that people ought to be treated with kindness and without anticipating anything in return.
        Since there are a lot of coincidences in this world, I believe it is amazing to let things unfold naturally without intervening.
